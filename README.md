# RestAPI_MERN
 A REST API for a MERN stack is a web service that allows client applications to interact with a database through a set of predefined HTTP requests. The API serves as the interface between the front-end (React) and back-end (Express and Node.js) of the application, allowing them to communicate and exchange data.
