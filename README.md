# RestAPI MERN
 A REST API for a MERN stack is a web service that allows client applications to interact with a database through a set of predefined HTTP requests. The API serves as the interface between the front-end (React) and back-end (Express and Node.js) of the application, allowing them to communicate and exchange data.

## About Author
Hi there! My name is Lakshay Kumar Kashyap and I'm a Software Developer with a focus on MERN stack development. I Love building web applications and finding elegant solutions to complex problems.

When I'm not coding, you can often find me exploring my other passions. I have a deep love for Singing, and enjoy expressing myself through music whenever I get the chance. I also enjoy cooking and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen and find gardening to be a relaxing and fulfilling pastime.

I've been an avid Chess player since I was 9 years old and have competed in many local tournaments. Chess has taught me valuable lessons about strategy, planning, and resilience, which I've been able to apply to my work as a Software Developer.

### `npm install`

Kindly run the Command after the clonig/installing my repository because node_modules are not included


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
